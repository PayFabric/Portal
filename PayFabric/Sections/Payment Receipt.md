# Summary
Merchant can turn on the feature that send payment receipt to end customers after a transaction is processed. To do this, navigate through **Settings** > **Email Receipt Templates**, each [Transaction Type](https://github.com/PayFabric/APIs/blob/master/PayFabric/Sections/Transaction%20Types.md) have their own email receipt template. Each device can configure different templates and can enable/disable this feature independently.

**Note**: 
1. Email receipt does not support for _Verify_ transaction.
2. The default receipt must include the required receipt data as accessible via required PF merchant configuration, transaction, or payment fields. 
3. By default, the merchant email receipt template will contain a Refund Policy field with default text at the bottom of the template.  PayFabric will not enforce merchants to update nor do we validate if they remove it.
4. For Gift Card transaction, only _Sale_ and _Void_ transaction types have email receipt template.
