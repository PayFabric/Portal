# Multi-factor authentication
PayFabric authentication is being updated to align with the security policies from Global Payments. 

# What is Multi Factor Authentication?
Multi-factor authentication is an extra layer of protection against cyberthreats like phishing attacks and account takeovers. It verifies your identity with two different “factors” of authentication when you log in. 

These factors could be:

1）Something you know: a password, PIN, or answer to a security question

2）Something you have: a smartphone, one-time pass token, or smart card

3）Something you are: biometrics, like your fingerprint

Why do you need multi factor authentication? It’s extra account security for an extra layer of protection.

# Your questions, answered
## How will future logins work?

Users navigating to the PayFabric login page will automatically be redirected to the new secure login page.

Once multi-factor authentication is setup, when a user logs into PayFabric, the will need to provide their additional authentication code from either their email, a text message or from an authenticator app.

After a user performs the multi-factor authentication procedure once, they will have the option to not have to verify their additional authentication method on the same browser for the next 28 days.

## Why the change?

## If I have an elevated account, do I have to set up MFA?
Yes. You’ll need to set up multi factor authentication for each of your accounts, including elevated ones.

## Can I change my primary authentication method?
Yes. You'll need to contact to support@PayFabric.com 

## What are the authentication method options?
Your authentication method options could be:

Your verified email, which was used during the Merchant Portal registration process

A text message (SMS) to your mobile phone 

An authenticator app installed on your device (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, Duo Mobile, or Microsoft Authenticator)

## What if I didn’t receive the verification code?

If you haven’t received your verification code, try these methods of troubleshooting:

1) Have a Resend link to send a new code — a sent code expires after five minutes.

2) If this is your first time authenticating with your chosen method, a third-party security app on your mobile phone might be blocking the text message. Try disabling the security app temporarily while you go through the authentication process again. 

3) If that doesn’t work, try selecting a new primary authentication method. 

4) If you still don’t receive the code using another method, contact support@payfabric.com.

Internal Employees with an ‘@globalpay.com’ email address will utilize their Global Payments credentials to access PayFabric which will also require multi-factor authentication to be setup. 

## How to login PayFabric with External Users?
